# My Work

This project is online at [jorb.dev](https://jorb.dev/)

Build using a simple boilerplate with TypeScript, React, NextJS and Styled Components.

Boiilerplate avalible on [helderburato/nextjs-boilerplate](https://github.com/helderburato/nextjs-boilerplate)

## What it works for

This project runs a website build to display some project that I build or worked on.
I decide to put this online on an personal website just to make it easier to send 
to people on short and more friendly url's, but once it's been done I shall probabily 
improve it a lot as a project it self and use to centralize the pratice of new 
libraries and techniques in the future.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Them it will be online at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
