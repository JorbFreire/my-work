# My Work

This project is online at [jorb.dev](https://jorb.dev/)

Build using a simple boilerplate with TypeScript, React, NextJS and Styled Components.

Boilerplate avalible on [helderburato/nextjs-boilerplate](https://github.com/helderburato/nextjs-boilerplate)

## What it works for

This project runs a website built to display some projects that I build or worked on.
I shall probably improve it a lot as a project itself and use it to centralize the
practice of new libraries and techniques in the future.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Mobile expandable previews slide modal
- [ ] Make the contact form work
- [ ] Responsive Images
- [ ] Find better quality assets

## Wanna custom and use it for yourself?
